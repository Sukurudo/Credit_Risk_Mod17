# Credit Risk Analysis; Low Risk Customers

# Project

Credit risk is an inherently unbalanced classification problem, as the number of good loans easily outnumber the number of risky loans. Therefore, youâ€™ll need to employ different techniques to train and evaluate models with unbalanced classes. Jill asks you to use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling. Your final task is to evaluate the performance of these models and make a recommendation on whether they should be used to predict credit risk.


#Results

| Model Name | Recall | Precision | Balanced Accuracy Score | 
| ----------- | ------ | --------- | ----------------------- | 
| Random Oversampling | 0.60 | 1.00 | 0.64 |
| SMOTE | 0.72 | 1.00 | 0.65 |
| Undersampling | 0.46 | 1.00 | 0.50 | 
| SMOTEENN | 0.54 | 1.00 | 0.62 | 
| Balanced Random Forest | 0.90 | 1.00 | 0.73 |
| ***Easy Ensemble AdaBoost | 0.95 | 1.00 | 0.91*** |

Based on the various methods used, i would recommend the Easy Ensemble AdaBoost methology. This gives us a accuracy of 91% which is the higest of all options. It also has a recall of 95%, which allows us to have the most low risk applications available to be processed.

Individual analysis of each methology is avaialble within the Jupyter Notebooks.
